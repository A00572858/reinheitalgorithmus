# Reinheit Algorithmus

The " Reinheit Algorithmus" or "Purity Algorithm" is a Machine Learning classification prediction algorithm which tells wether a beer, based on its IBU (International Bitterness Unit) and ABV (Alcohol By Volume), is an IPA (Indian Pale Ale) styled beer.

The file "beers.csv" contains data on 2000+ american craft beers

## Notes on current version
I get an Overflow Error with the exp function of math and numpy when trying to calculate the Sigmoid function.
